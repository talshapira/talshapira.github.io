Winner of the [NetML](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/526/overview) Network Traffic Analytics Challenge 2020 (TAU-Team).

[NetML Challenge 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13006) is a machine learning driven network traffic analytic challenge where participants are required to apply novel machine learning technologies in order to detect malicious flows or distinguish between applications in a fine-grained fashion among network flows.

In the challenge's dataset, each flow is represented by 121 features extracted from up to 200 packets in both directions as described by [Barut etal.]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13006)) and is labeled by 2 or 3 hierarchical multi-labels. The dataset consists of records of over 1M flows and relies on 3 public sources: NetML, CICIDS2017 and non-vpn2016.

The challenge is composed of 7 tracks, 4 of them for malware detection and the rest are for traffic classification.
We , the TAU-Team, are the only team to capture one of the top 3 places in all of the tracks and first place in more than one. In this document, we share technical details of our approach for Track-3 and Track-5, where we got first place.
